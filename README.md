## BearMaps

#### Demo: https://bearmaps1.herokuapp.com/

An interactive map web app with functions of rastering, labeling, auto-completion and navigation. Implement Heap, Trie, K-D Tree and A\* search from scratch in Java to learn object-oriented programming. The frontend is developed with jQuery.

- [x] Test with JUnit
- [x] Built by Maven
- [x] Deployed on Heroku

### Usage

`mvn install` Build the whole project

`mvn test` Run unit tests

Note that the process of building artifact is skipped for deployment efficiency. Comment out line 82 and 90â€“92 in `pom.xml` to enable it; then `mvn install` will generate an executable JAR, which can run locally.
